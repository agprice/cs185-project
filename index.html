                Breaking news! Local programmers have encountered perhaps what is the most questionable programming language ever created, and it's gone
                mainstream! As of this point, every web browser in the world was currently found to have traces of this language.
                There is no sign of an end to the proliferation. This language has no classes, no static typing, no packages, and no interfaces.
                Somehow however, it has taken over the internet as the scripting language of choice. While in the age of Flash, many programmers 
                were hopeful that the superior and enhanced Actionscript 3 would dominate, with the fall of Adobe, Javascript has become the most common 
                language for programming interactivity on the web. Experts say the internet may never recover from the paradigm shift.
